* Emacs Config

/This document follows the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][literate programming]] paradigm to setup Emacs according to my needs./

** Install use-package
   I prefer installing packages with [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] since it makes easier to organize code by grouping a package installation with it's configuration.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (unless (package-installed-p 'use-package)
         (package-refresh-contents)
         (package-install 'use-package))
   #+END_SRC
