* My Emacs configuration file
  I decided to use literate programming for my configuration file, mainly spired by [[http://sachachua.com/][Sacha Chua]], since it's easier to read an understand what's going on in my conf and what kind of packages I'm using and I'm trying to learn.
* Basic configuration

First I have to add ~/.emacs.d to the load path in order to easily load additional .el files 
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(add-to-list 'load-path user-emacs-directory) ;; ~/.emacs.d
#+end_src

I also gatta check if the current environment is a mac computer.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(setq is-mac (equal system-type 'darwin))
#+end_src

* Package.el

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(require 'package)

(package-initialize)

;; Repositories
(setq package-archives '(("gnu" . "http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")
                         ("marmalade" . "http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/")
                         ("melpa" . "http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/")))
#+end_src


* Projectile
  In order to have projectile enabled globally I have to call it's gobal-mode function.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(projectile-global-mode)
#+END_SRC
* TODOS
** TODO Check how to make the lines not to be hidden when the screen is thinner than text.
