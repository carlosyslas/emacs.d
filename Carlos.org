* My Emacs configuration file
  I decided to use literate programming for my configuration file, mainly spired by [[http://sachachua.com/][Sacha Chua]], since it's easier to read an understand what's going on in my conf and what kind of packages I'm using and I'm trying to learn.
* Projectile
  In order to have projectile enabled globally I have to call it's gobal-mode function.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(projectile-global-mode)
#+END_SRC
